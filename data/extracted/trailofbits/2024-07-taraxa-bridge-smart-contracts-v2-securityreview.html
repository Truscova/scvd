    Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often reliant on information that may be provided by a client, its affiliates, or its partners. As a result, the findings documented in this report should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, flaws, or defects in the target system or codebase.

    Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test the controls and security properties of software. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but each has its limitations: for example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that violates a property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. Their use is also limited by the time and resource constraints of a project.

    Executive Summary

   <h2>
    Engagement Overview
   </h2>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Taraxa engaged Trail of Bits to continue a review of the security of its bridge smart contracts at commit f82dd87 and to conduct a best-effort review of the Beacon chain light client at commit b2eafad. The contracts within the bridge repo facilitate the bridging of tokens between the Taraxa and Ethereum chains. The Beacon chain light client facilitates light client proofs of a beacon chain (which is used by the bridge contracts).
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Although this was meant to be a continuation of the review of the previous bridge review (commit ec89224), the provided commit for this audit (f82dd87) included an almost complete rewrite of the bridge smart contracts. Therefore, we spent a considerable amount of time on re-reviewing the entire implementation, instead of purely focusing on the parts not covered during the original audit. This limited the depth of our review (as well as our best-effort review of the Beacon chain light client).
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    A team of two consultants conducted the review from July 8 to July 14, 2024, for a total of 1.6 engineer-weeks of effort. With full access to source code and documentation, we performed static and dynamic testing of the codebase, using automated and manual processes.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Observations and Impact
   </h2>
   <p block-type="Text">
    We identified seven issues during this short engagement, three of which are high severity. The first issue
    <a href="#page-9-1">
     (TOB-TARA-1)
    </a>
    shows how not using a "safe" ERC20 transfer function can lead to loss of funds for users when dealing with particular non-standard ERC20 tokens.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    The second issue (
    <a href="#page-12-0">
     TOB-TARA-4)
    </a>
    allows anyone to arbitrarily inflate the votes for a given PillarBlock during finalization; i.e., it is possible to finalize PillarBlocks that did not receive enough votes from validators to pass the threshold. This issue highlights the importance of validating all inputs and correctly handling all edge-cases.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    The third high-severity issue (
    <a href="#page-16-0">
     TOB-TARA-6)
    </a>
    shows a reentrancy-related vulnerability that allows hook-enabled tokens (ERC777) to be drained from a ERC20 locking connector. Additionally, whenever this reentrancy is performed, it will corrupt the internal state; this would break the contract and require an upgrade to fix. This issue highlights the danger of not adhering to the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern and/or not using reentrancy guards. Additionally, this issue highlights the usefulness of using
    <a href="https://github.com/crytic/slither">
     Slither
    </a>
    to perform static analysis on Solidity smart contracts, as Slither detects this issue.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    We also want to highlight that the inline documentation could be significantly improved. This would have likely uncovered
    <a href="#page-14-0">
     TOB-TARA-5,
    </a>
    and overall would make the implementation

     <li block-type="ListItem">
      <b>
       Remediate the findings disclosed in this report.

      These findings should be addressed as part of a direct remediation or as part of any refactor that may occur when addressing other recommendations.

     <li block-type="ListItem">
      <b>
       Improve the inline documentation.
      </b>
      Writing inline comments may cause issues to become obvious. Additionally, this would make it easier to understand the implementation, especially the various if-statements it contains.
     </li>
     <li block-type="ListItem">
      <b>
       Perform a full audit of the beacon-light-client repository.
      </b>
      During this short review, we performed only a best-effort review of the beacon-light-client repo. Additionally, as stated in the Engagement Overview, the changing of commits required us to re-review the entire bridge repo; as a result, we had very limited time to review the beacon-light-client.
     </li>
     <li block-type="ListItem">
      <b>
       Perform another audit of the bridge repository once it is finalized.
      </b>
      As stated in the Engagement Overview section, due to changing of commits, the level of depth we achieved during this short review was insufficient for us to be reasonably confident that no more bugs are present. Performing another audit would increase confidence in the security of the implementation and would likely uncover more issues. Additionally, examination of the amount of changes between the previous and current commits of our reviews suggests that the bridge repo is not yet in a finished state. We recommend reviewing it once it has been finalized and no more changes are planned.

    Description

   <p block-type="Text">
    The applyState function in the ERC20LockingConnectorLogic contract uses the transfer function instead of the safeTransfer function provided by the SafeERC20 library. This can cause tokens whose transfer function does not conform to the ERC20 specification to behave incorrectly. In particular, it could result in no tokens being transferred to a recipient while the contract behaves as though the tokens did get transferred and does not revert, leading to loss of funds.

   <h4>
    Description
   </h4>
   <p block-type="Text">
    The lack of reentrancy guards on the applyState function allows the stealing of hook-supporting tokens by calling applyState recursively. Since no popular tokens support this standard or hooks in general, this limits the impact of this issue. However, because the epoch incorrectly increments whenever applyState is called through reentrancy, this will likely prevent the broken bridge contract's applyState function from accepting valid bridge messages, since the epoch does not match what is expected.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    The applyState function can be called by anyone and will apply bridged messages (either from Ethereum to Taraxa, or vice versa). Inside this function, the epoch in the input arguments is validated to be one above the current epoch (called appliedEpoch, as highlighted in yellow in figure 6.1). At the very end of the function, the appliedEpoch is incremented (as highlighted in blue in figure 6.1). In the middle of the function, a loop over all of the bridged messages is performed; this will call the applyState function of the configured connector (as highlighted in green in figure 6.1). These will then transfer the tokens to the recipient (this could involve transferring an ERC20 token amount, minting an ERC20 token amount, or transferring an amount of the chain's native token).
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    In the case of an ERC20 transfer in which the token to be transferred is an ERC777 (or an otherwise hook-supporting token) contract, the recipient can use reentrancy to call back into the BridgeBase.applyState function with the same arguments. This works since appliedEpoch is incremented only at the end of the function.

    Exploit Scenario
   </h4>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Eve holds 1,000 of an ERC777 token called TokenX in a contract she has deployed (called AttackerContract). Eve bridges these 1,000 TokenX from Ethereum to Taraxa. Eve's 1,000 tokens are now locked inside the configured ERC20LockingConnector on Ethereum. After bridging to Taraxa, she immediately initiates a bridge of 1,000 TokenX from Taraxa back to Ethereum.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    She now monitors the Ethereum chain to spot the first time anyone tries to call the EthBridge.applyState function to bridge messages, which includes her bridging message. Once she spots it, she front-runs the transaction and calls EthBridge.applyState with the same arguments.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    The message handling loop will now call the TokenX.transfer function to transfer the 1,000 tokens to AttackerContract, after which the ERC777 _callTokensToReceived hook will call AttackerContract. Inside the called AttackerContract function, a call is made back to EthBridge.applyState with the same arguments as the original call. This will lead to a loop where each time EthBridge.applyState is called, the AttackerContract will receive 1,000 TokenX tokens.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    The only limitations of this attack are gas, the amount of TokenX inside the ERC20LockingConnector, and the failure of other bridging messages due to lack of tokens or multiple executions.

    Since Solidity 0.8.0, the address.code member is available. To get the size of the code at an address, use address.code.length. Since Solidity 0.8.1, the address.code.length operation uses extcodesize under the hood instead of copying all the code before checking the length, which is very gas inefficient.

    This code could be simplified by removing the shouldFinalize variable and directly returning false after the loop. Alternatively, since the default value of a Boolean is false, this could be done by altogether skipping the return false, which would implicitly return false.
