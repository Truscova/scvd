    Executive Summary
   </h1>
   <p block-type="Text">
    From September 16th through September 20th, 2019, Flexa engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of the Flexa staking system. Trail of Bits conducted this assessment over the course of two person-weeks with two engineers working from commit 6128...b54.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    The review focused on the Flexa staking system's Merkle tree operations, where off-chain and on-chain operations complement each other. Situations where system operations and state transitions could lead to lost, trapped, or stolen funds were of particular interest during review. The codebase was reviewed using
    <a href="https://github.com/crytic/slither">
     Slither
    </a>
    , a Solidity static analysis tool, and manual review.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    In total, seven findings were identified, ranging from high to informational severity. Notably, we found that an integer overflow will cause the withdrawal period to be activated upon the contract's deployment, and that a race condition can allow a user to perform one additional withdrawal if the system is unstable.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    To help prevent problems in the future, code quality recommendations have been detailed in
    <a href="#page-25-0">
     Appendix
    </a>
    B. These recommendations are oriented towards enhancing code readability and preventing future vulnerabilities from being introduced.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Overall, the staking contract was written with an understanding of common smart contract pitfalls. No critical flaws were found, and most issues were related to improper configuration or abuse of off-chain resources. Improvements could be made in the documentation, particularly the description of the withdrawal procedure and assumptions for nonces.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Flexa should address these findings before production deployment, and consider adding an incident response plan to the system documentation. Trail of Bits recommends an assessment of the off-chain code before deploying the system.

    Engagement Goals
   </h1>
   <p block-type="Text">
    The engagement was scoped to provide a security assessment of the Flexa staking system's Ethereum smart contracts. While the off-chain components of the system were not within the scope of this engagement, the effect of malicious on-chain operations on off-chain components was considered during review.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Specifically, we sought to answer the following questions:
   </p>
   <p block-type="ListGroup">
    <ul>
     <li block-type="ListItem">
      Can funds become trapped or non-withdrawable?
     </li>
     <li block-type="ListItem">
      Can funds be stolen by a malicious user withdrawing funds?
     </li>
     <li block-type="ListItem">
      Is there any way to cause a Denial of Service for off-chain infrastructure dependent on on-chain infrastructure?
     </li>
     <li block-type="ListItem">
      Can a malicious user exploit the on-chain Merkle tree operations?
     </li>
     <li block-type="ListItem">
      Can the fallback root operations be manipulated maliciously?

     Merkle tree.

   <p block-type="Text">
    <b>
     Withdrawal.
    </b>
    We reviewed the nonce usage to ensure that a withdrawal could not take place multiple times. We took into consideration front-running and replay attacks.

   <p block-type="Text">
    <b>
     Withdrawal fallback.
    </b>
    We checked that a deposit could not be withdrawn if accepted by the Merkle tree, and we looked for ways to bypass the fallback mechanism restrictions.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Only the smart contract was reviewed. We did not assess the off-chain code, and assumed the correct Merkle tree generation and reporting. We assumed that deposits are included in the fallback root before their amount are included in the standard withdrawal tree.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Additionally, Flexa was aware of the loss or benefit of funds due to the off-chain/on-chain balance's desynchronisation reached after the withdrawal period.

    This section combines all the recommendations made during the engagement. Short-term recommendations address the immediate issues. Long-term recommendations pertain to the development process and long-term design goals.

    Short Term ❑
    <b>
     Change the initial value of _fallbackSetDate (Staking.sol#L41) to prevent overflow with _fallbackWithdrawalDelaySeconds (Staking.sol#L25).
    </b>
    The overflow will trigger the withdrawal period upon the contract's deployment. ❑
    <b>
     Prevent overflow on the withdrawal period verification in withdrawFallback and refundPendingDeposit.
    </b>
    The overflow will trigger the withdrawal period upon the contract's deployment. ❑
    <b>
     Document how to update the fallback root if the withdrawal period is active.
    </b>
    To prevent additional withdrawals, the update should be split into two calls: ● the first call setting to the previous root, and ● the second to the updated one.
   </h3>
   <p block-type="ListGroup">
    <ul>
     <li block-type="ListItem">
      ❑
      <b>
       Add the nonce to the PendingDepositRefund event. Ensure the off-chain code uses it.
      </b>
      The lack of nonce information can mislead off-chain code to think another deposit was removed.
     </li>
     <li block-type="ListItem">
      ❑
      <b>
       Ensure documentation is provided on the expected functionality of the withdrawal  root–related functions.

      This should include the potential for duplicate roots to be posted.
     </li>
     <li block-type="ListItem">

    Long Term ❑
    <b>
     Use SafeMath for all arithmetic operations.
    </b>
    It is a best practice to use SafeMath to prevent arithmetic issues. ❑
    <b>
     Write an incident response plan that includes strategies to handle compromise and network congestion.
    </b>
    Having a procedure to follow will prevent errors when reacting quickly to a compromise. ❑
    <b>
     Document every field that is needed for the off-chain code and ensure their information is correctly emitted to the on-chain code.
    </b>
    Any assumption on the off-chain &lt;-&gt; on-chain interactions must be thoroughly documented to be properly verified. ❑
    <b>
     To prevent a deleted root from being added again, consider:
    </b>
    ●
    <b>
     Adding a method of validating whether a root has been previously encountered, or ● Adding the nonce as a leaf of the root.
    </b>
    Adding a previously deleted root might lead to unexpected behavior for third parties. ❑
    <b>
     Expand testing to include zero-value tests and ensure validation is appropriate even for unexpected inputs. Document the expected inputs for each function.
    </b>
    Lack of input validation can easily lead to incorrect configuration of the contract. ❑
    <b>
     Use a two-step process of transferOwnership and acceptOwnership to ensure an address is controllable before confirming ownership transfer.
    </b>
    setOwner will set the new owner without any verification of the destination. Calling setOwner with an incorrect value may be an irrevocable error. ❑

    setOwner changes ownership of the contract in a single transaction. If an incorrect newOwnerAddress is provided, ownership may never be recovered. A best practice is to split the ownership into two functions: transfer and accept.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    By splitting the functionality of setOwner into two functions—transferOwnership and acceptOwnership—the original owner will retain owner abilities until the new owner calls acceptOwnership. This will prevent accidental transfer of ownership to an uncontrolled address.

    C. Fix Log
   </h1>
   <p block-type="Text">
    On September 26th, 2019, Trail of Bits reviewed the fixes proposed by Flexa regarding the issues presented in this report.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Flexa remediated five issues, mitigated one issue off-chain, and accepted the risk of one issue. Trail of Bits only reviewed code in the smart contract; therefore, mitigations that are implemented off-chain were not reviewed. Each smart contract code change was reviewed to understand the comprehensiveness of the proposed remediation. The original commit under review was 6128...ab54, and the commit containing the reviewed fixes is 12ab...94cb.

    To correct this issue, the resetFallbackMechanismDate function has been added, which sets the fallback date to the current block timestamp at the time of invocation. Then, all deposits made prior to the mined timestamp are integrated into the root off-chain and published to chain. This allows both on- and off-chain components to prevent the additional withdrawal.

    The setOwner function has been replaced with authorizeOwnershipTransfer and assumeOwnership, preventing loss of contract ownership due to the lack of validation. Appropriate events have also been added. Validation of the root parameter has been added for addWithdrawalRoot and setFallbackRoot, preventing a root value of 0. Similarly, setFallbackWithdrawalDelay now has validations for the newFallbackDelaySeconds parameter, and no longer allows a 0 value.
