    Security assessment projects are time-boxed and often reliant on information that may be provided by a client, its affiliates, or its partners. As a result, the findings documented in this report should not be considered a comprehensive list of security issues, flaws, or defects in the target system or codebase.

   <p block-type="Text">
    Trail of Bits uses automated testing techniques to rapidly test the controls and security properties of software. These techniques augment our manual security review work, but each has its limitations: for example, a tool may not generate a random edge case that violates a property or may not fully complete its analysis during the allotted time. Their use is also limited by the time and resource constraints of a project.

    Executive Summary
   </h1>
   <h3>
    Engagement Overview
   </h3>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Offchain Labs engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of their Timeboost auction contracts. These contracts implement the on-chain components of a sealed-bid, second-price auction for the rights to assign an express lane controller whose transactions are processed faster by the sequencer for a set period of time.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    A team of three consultants conducted the review from August 19 to August 27, 2024, for a total of three engineer-weeks of effort. With full access to source code and documentation, we performed static and dynamic testing of the codebase using automated and manual processes.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Observations and Impact
   </h3>
   <p block-type="Text">
    The codebase includes extensive NatSpec documentation, and the project's specification provides a comprehensive description of the system's functionality, the roles involved, and the auction mechanism, though we did note several minor discrepancies between the written specification and the implementation.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    During the review, we evaluated the access controls, the accuracy of updating the round timing info, the possibility of malicious bidders evading bidding amount, the potential for introducing bias during the selection of the winning bid, and any possibility that could halt the auction's progression. Our review resulted in three issues ranging in severity from medium to informational. The medium-severity issue highlights an unhandled edge case that could prevent an auction round from being finalized
    <a href="#page-13-1">
     (TOB-ELA-1)
    </a>
    , and the remaining informational issues are related to discrepancies with the specification
    <a href="#page-15-0">
     (TOB-ELA-2,
    </a>
    <a href="#page-17-0">
     TOB-ELA-3)
    </a>
    .
   </p>
   <h3>
    Recommendations
   </h3>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Based on the codebase maturity evaluation and findings identified during the security review, Trail of Bits recommends that Offchain Labs take the following steps:
   </p>
   <p block-type="ListGroup">
    <ul>
     <li block-type="ListItem">
      <b>
       Remediate the TOB-ELA-002 issue disclosed in this report.
      </b>
      This finding should be addressed as part of a direct remediation or as part of any refactor that may occur when addressing other recommendations.
     </li>
     <li block-type="ListItem">
      <b>
       Add a stateful fuzzing test suite.
      </b>
      Trail of Bits considers stateful fuzzing to be a baseline requirement for DeFi protocols and applications and recommends fuzzing the system's user flows and arithmetic calculations.

   <p block-type="Text">
    ●
    <b>
     Align implementation with the specification.
    </b>
    A number of discrepancies exist between the specification and the actual implementation. These two should be aligned to eliminate any gaps between them.

    The engagement was scoped to provide a security assessment of Offchain Labs' Timeboost design. Specifically, we sought to answer the following non-exhaustive list of questions:
   </p>
   <p block-type="ListGroup">

     <li block-type="ListItem">
      Are proper access controls used in the contracts that users interact with?

    Project Coverage
   </h1>
   <p block-type="Text">
    This section provides an overview of the analysis coverage of the review, as determined by our high-level engagement goals. Our approaches included the following:
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    ●
    <b>
     Timeboost auction smart contracts
    </b>
    . The on-chain part of the Timeboost auction protocol is implemented using several smart contracts, which will allow any user to deposit funds, withdraw their funds, or temporarily select the express lane controller if they win the auction. Privileged users can also perform administrative operations, such as change the protocol parameters or resolve auctions, by submitting bids received off-chain.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    We reviewed these contracts for common Solidity issues as well as any issues related to access control violations, accuracy of updating round timing information, and any deviations of the implementation from the standard. We also explored the potential for malicious bidders to manipulate bidding amounts during the auction, the possibility of fund loss or theft from the contracts, and whether users from the protocol could block bids, or somehow delay or disrupt the auction.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Coverage Limitations
   </h3>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Because of the time-boxed nature of testing work, it is common to encounter coverage limitations. The following list outlines the coverage limitations of the engagement and indicates system elements that may warrant further review:

    Codebase Maturity Evaluation
   </h1>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Trail of Bits uses a traffic-light protocol to provide each client with a clear understanding of the areas in which its codebase is mature, immature, or underdeveloped. Deficiencies identified here often stem from root causes within the software development life cycle that should be addressed through standardization measures (e.g., the use of common libraries, functions, or frameworks) or training and awareness programs.

       Overall, the system does not rely on complex arithmetic,
       <br/>
       and arithmetic use seems safe. Additionally, the protocol
       <br/>
       is implemented using Solidity 0.8.9, which has overflow
       <br/>
       protection by default for arithmetic operations, and the
       <br/>
       contracts do not include any unchecked
       <br/>
       blocks. The
       <br/>
       system's operations depend on certain privileged actors
       <br/>
       manually executing essential tasks (via off-chain
       <br/>
       executions). However, certain features, such as the round
       <br/>
       offset that relies on signed numbers, should be properly
       <br/>
       documented in the code and the standard to ensure that
       <br/>
       their properties are not violated by other contracts.

   </h4>
   <p block-type="Text">
    The reserve price is set to zero and Alice is the sole bidder for a round. Since this is a second-price auction, she should pay the reserve price when the auction for this round is resolved. The auctioneer calls the resolveSingleBidAuction function and passes in Alice's bid. The call reverts when it attempts to deduct zero tokens from Alice's balance. As a result, no express lane controller can be assigned for that round.

   <p block-type="Text">
    Short term, consider allowing the reduce function to decrement zero.

    Description

   <p block-type="Text">
    Bids that are submitted to an express lane auction round include signatures that must be validated on-chain. While reviewing the specification and implementation, we identified several minor discrepancies between the documentation and the contract's use of signatures. These differences do not compromise the integrity of the signatures used by the system, but may result in integration issues for third parties attempting to bid.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    The written specification defines a bid as containing "(chainId, auctionContractAddress, roundNumber, bid, expressLaneControllerAddress, signature)" and defines the signature as being "signature by the bidder's private key on the tuple (chainId, auctionContractAddress, roundNumber, bid, expressLaneControllerAddress)". A code comment in the IExpressLaneAuction contract further specifies an EIP-191 personal_sign message format for the signature using all of the fields mentioned above (though with the order of the last two fields swapped).
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    However, the contract actually expects an EIP-712 signature with the chainId and auctionContractAddress in the domain separator, and the actual bid being constructed of the remaining three fields (again, with the order of the last two fields swapped relative to the specification), as shown in figure 2.1.

    This also has trickle-down effects on how ties will be broken by the contract. The specification states that if the top two bidders submit bids with identical amounts, then "the tie is broken by hashing the bidder address concatenated with the respective byte-string representation of the bid using the Keccak256 hashing scheme." However, since the contract considers a bid to be constructed differently than the specification, the outcome of the tie breaking process will differ. Additionally, rather than concatenating the bidder's address with the full byte-string representation of the bid, the contract uses a hash of the bid (figure 2.2).
   </p>
   <pre>460 // when bids have the same amount we break ties based on the bid hash

   <p block-type="Text">
    According to the Timeboost specification, after deducting the funds from the highest bidder, the contract should "transfer those funds to a beneficiary account designated by governance, or burn them if governance specifies that the proceeds are to be burned." However, the contract does not include any mechanism to signal that the proceeds should be burned either at the time of auction resolution or when the funds are later transferred out of the contract. At the time of auction resolution, the funds are escrowed in an internal beneficiary account (figure 3.1) that can be emptied at a later date.

    D. Smart Contract Fuzzing Recommendations
   </h1>
   <p block-type="Text">
    The following recommendations are related to the use of fuzz testing on the Express Lane Auction smart contracts.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    ● Make sure you cover both stateless and stateful invariants. The current code favors stateless tests, even if the code is used with different states. For instance, this is how the Balance contract tests that balances are reduced to zero after the withdrawal round:
   </p>
   <pre>51 function testBalanceAtRound(
52 uint256 initialBalance,
53 uint64 initialRound,
54 uint64 withdrawalRound
55 ) public {
56 Balance memory bal = Balance(initialBalance, initialRound);
57 BalanceImp b = new BalanceImp(bal);
58 if (withdrawalRound &gt;= initialRound) {
59 assertEq(b.balanceAtRound(withdrawalRound), 0);
60 } else {
61 assertEq(b.balanceAtRound(withdrawalRound), initialBalance);
62 }
63 }</pre>
   <p>
    <i>
     Figure D.1: The testBalanceAtRound fuzz test for checking how the contract behaves depending on the withdrawal round (
     <a href="https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/9dc19d21c0ba0df89529cc0085915fa9565ecafd/test/foundry/ExpressLaneBalance.t.sol#L51-L63">
      test/foundry/ExpressLaneBalance.t.sol#L51-L63
     </a>
     )
    </i>
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Though the Balance contract can change its state over different transactions, this test is really stateless since the state is simulated using different parameter values instead of actually executing different operations (deployment, startWithdrawal, and endWithdrawal). This pattern should be avoided; instead, use invariant testing that initializes the Balance contract once and checks different types of invariants when different operations are executed (e.g., after a successful withdrawal, the balance of the user should be zero). Additional guidance on introducing stateful fuzzing can be found in Trail of Bits'
