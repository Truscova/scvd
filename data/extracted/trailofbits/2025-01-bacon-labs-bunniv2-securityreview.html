    Engagement Overview
   </h2>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Bacon Labs engaged Trail of Bits to review the security of its Bunni v2 smart contracts. Bunni v2 is an automated market maker (AMM) built on top of Uniswap v4 that allows users to implement custom behavior and liquidity curves. It introduces multiple new features: an auction-managed AMM (am-AMM) to optimize swap fees and recapture MEV, liquidity density functions (LDFs) to allow liquidity providers to provide liquidity in complex shapes and dynamically switch between liquidity shapes, autonomous rebalancing, rehypothecation into yield bearing vaults, and surge fees to protect against sandwich attacks.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    A team of three consultants conducted the review from September 23 to October 22, 2024, for a total of eight engineer-weeks of effort. Our testing efforts focused on reviewing the contracts for common Solidity pitfalls; reviewing the internal accounting; reviewing interactions with external contracts, such as the Uniswap v4 PoolManager, FloodPlain, and Permit2 contracts; reviewing access controls; and assessing risks related to interacting with arbitrary hooks, hooklets, vaults, and tokens. Additionally, we reviewed the rounding directions and the magnitude of arithmetic errors in the LDFs and BunniSwapMath, and we looked into issues related to token approvals, round-trip swaps, swaps happening on edge ticks, and equivalency and symmetricity of various calculations. With full access to source code and documentation, we performed static and dynamic testing of the Bunni v2 codebase, using automated and manual processes.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    The commit under review was previously reviewed, and a list of known issues was shared with us prior to starting this security review. Any vulnerabilities present in this list, which includes high-severity issues in multiple components, were considered known and have been omitted from this report.
   </p>
   <h1>
    Observations and Impact
   </h1>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Bunni v2 uses a singleton design where the ERC-6909 tokens minted via the Uniswap v4 PoolManager contract are kept together in the BunniHub contract. This increases the flexibility and extensibility of the protocol; however, it comes with inherent risks that a single protocol vulnerability can drain the entirety of the protocol total value locked (TVL). This is mitigated by reducing trust assumptions when interacting with external contracts and keeping separate internal accounting values for each pool.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    The codebase allows arbitrary hooks, hooklets, LDFs, tokens, and vaults to be used with the protocol. A pool can have up to two ERC-4626 vaults, one for each token of the pool, which can be used for rehypothecation. Since these vaults are arbitrary contracts, the protocol guards against misuse by not trusting the return values of the vault functions and instead

    <a href="#page-23-0">
     (TOB-BUNNI-2)
    </a>
    after use, which increases the risks of token theft.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    The rebalance mechanism allows pools to be automatically rebalanced by using an external protocol FloodPlain for the settling of the created rebalance orders. However, this rebalancing mechanism contains multiple flaws: the access controls are insufficient to protect against token theft
    <a href="#page-31-0">
     (TOB-BUNNI-6
    </a>
    ), the sequential execution of the rebalance preand post-hooks is not enforced
    <a href="#page-35-0">
     (TOB-BUNNI-7
    </a>
    ), and the excess amounts calculation can be inflated to drain the pool
    <a href="#page-40-0">
     (TOB-BUNNI-9
    </a>
    ). Furthermore, the FloodPlain codebase itself contains high-severity vulnerabilities and does not appear to have gone through a security review.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    The codebase contains complex mathematical operations, particularly around the swap functionality and liquidity density functions. During our invariant testing of these components, we identified several issues, including a few high-severity ones. Noteworthy issues include arithmetic and rounding errors
    <a href="#page-50-0">
     (TOB-BUNNI-13

    ), users obtaining free tokens during swaps

    ), the potential for round-trip swaps to yield profit
    <a href="#page-57-0">
     (TOB-BUNNI-16

    ), and different swap configurations resulting in varying input/output token amounts, allowing users to provide fewer tokens for the same output

    ).

   <h2>
    Recommendations
   </h2>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Based on the codebase maturity evaluation and findings identified during the security review, Trail of Bits recommends that Bacon Labs take the following steps prior to deploying the system:
   </p>
   <p block-type="ListGroup">
    <ul>
     <li block-type="ListItem">
      <b>
       Remediate the findings disclosed in this report and the prior security review.
      </b>
      These findings should be addressed as part of a direct remediation or as part of any refactor that may occur when addressing other recommendations. Consider an additional security review due to the extent of the changes necessary to remediate all of the issues.
     </li>
     <li block-type="ListItem">
      <b>
       Create a thorough stateful fuzzing suite and triage the pending property failures included in this report.
      </b>
      Due to the complexity of the protocol and lack of a systematic approach to rounding and arithmetic errors, there is a high likelihood that the LDFs and BunniSwapMath contain multiple issues that can be abused for a profit. System- and function-level invariants should be created and tested with both stateful and stateless fuzzing, and the failing properties included in this report should be investigated further.
     </li>
     <li block-type="ListItem">
      <b>
       ● Improve the testing suite.
      </b>
      While the testing suite covers most normal system behavior and uses stateless fuzzing for a large number of library functions, there is a clear lack of coverage of common adversarial situations. The coverage of the testing suite should be improved, testing for both normal system behavior and adversarial situations.

    This section provides an overview of the analysis coverage of the review, as determined by our high-level engagement goals. Our approaches included the following:

   <p block-type="ListGroup">
    <ul>
     <li block-type="ListItem">
      <b>
       BunniHub and BunniHubLogic.
      </b>
      We reviewed the BunniHub and BunniHubLogic contracts for transaction reordering risks, such as the ability to front run deposits and the initialization and deployment of a BunniToken and pool, and the impact of interactions with arbitrary hooks, hooklets, tokens, and vaults. We looked into the access controls to identify if there is a way to bypass access controls or fake the caller via the multicall contracts. We looked at how liquidity is deposited and withdrawn, looking for accounting errors and missing validation. Additionally, we reviewed how native assets are handled and refunded, how swaps are handled through the hook callback, and the trust assumptions around how data returned from calls to the ERC-4626 vaults is handled.
     </li>
     <li block-type="ListItem">
      <b>
       BunniHook and BunniHookLogic.
      </b>
      We reviewed the BunniHook and BunniHookLogic contracts to identify missing or insufficient access controls, whether privileged role actions can have a negative impact on users, and whether configurable parameters have reasonable limits (
      <a href="#page-38-0">
       TOB-BUNNI-8
      </a>
      ). We looked into the trust assumptions made when interacting with the FloodPlain contracts to determine if rebalance orders can be faked, executed multiple times, or in any way used to steal assets for legitimate liquidity pools (
      <a href="#page-31-0">
       TOB-BUNNI-6,

      ,
      <a href="#page-40-0">
       TOB-BUNNI-9)
      </a>
      . We investigated how swaps and initialization are handled, how fees are accrued and claimed, how surge fees are activated and calculated, and how interactions with the Uniswap v4 PoolManager contract are handled. We reviewed the calculations, looking for incorrect rounding directions or unhandled arithmetic errors that would result in tokens being extracted from a pool.

     <li block-type="ListItem">
      <b>
       BunniToken.

      We reviewed if the calculation, distribution, and claiming of scores and rewards can be abused to grief users, claim rewards multiple times, or extract value from the BunniToken. We checked if the implementation contains common ERC-20 vulnerabilities such as minting via self-transfers. This component contained a large number of known issues that are not included in this report.

    Codebase Maturity Evaluation

   <p block-type="Text">
    Trail of Bits uses a traffic-light protocol to provide each client with a clear understanding of the areas in which its codebase is mature, immature, or underdeveloped. Deficiencies identified here often stem from root causes within the software development life cycle that should be addressed through standardization measures (e.g., the use of common libraries, functions, or frameworks) or training and awareness programs.

       Arithmetic
      </td>
      <td>
       Most instances of unchecked arithmetic are clearly
       <br/>
       documented and contain validation to prevent
       <br/>
       underflows. Much of the math is abstracted away
       <br/>
       through the LDFs, BunniSwapMath,
       <br/>
       or Uniswap libraries.
       <br/>
       However, the math is very complex and the system lacks
       <br/>
       a systematic approach to rounding and arithmetic errors.
       <br/>
       There are multiple instances of code paths that check for
       <br/>
       errors and either truncate the value or rerun the
       <br/>
       calculation multiple times. This indicates that the system
       <br/>
       contains large relative arithmetic errors that could
       <br/>
       potentially be abused to extract value from the system.
       <br/>
       The properties defined in the Automated Testing section
       <br/>
       indicate that the math is insufficiently robust.
       <br/>
       It would be beneficial to fuzz the math libraries more
       <br/>
       thoroughly and investigate the failing properties further.
       <br/>
       Operations should be fuzzed for equivalence and
       <br/>
       symmetricity, and rounding direction should be enforced
       <br/>
       such that they always favor the protocol.

       <br/>
       We did not evaluate a potential monitoring strategy, nor

       an incident response plan, and these areas would require

       additional investigation.

       The interactions between the BunniHub,
       <br/>
       BunniHook,
       <br/>
       the
       <br/>
       Uniswap v4 PoolManager
       <br/>
       contract, and FloodPlain
       <br/>
       each have strict access controls. However, a vulnerability
       <br/>
       in any of the components could lead to a legitimate pool
       <br/>
       being drained, as demonstrated by TOB-BUNNI-6.
       <br/>
       Additionally, the AmAmm
       <br/>
       manager has a large amount of
       <br/>
       power over the pool that they manage, being able to
       <br/>
       arbitrarily set fees. Since anyone can become the AmAmm
       <br/>
       manager of a pool, this power should be limited by
       <br/>
       choosing reasonable swap fee limits for each pool.
       <br/>
       The protocol uses Permit2
       <br/>
       to handle most token
       <br/>
       transfers and uses the isValidSignature
       <br/>
       function as
       <br/>
       an access control for Permit2
       <br/>
       signatures provided for
       <br/>
       the rebalancing mechanism. This function, along with the
       <br/>
       access control between BunniHook
       <br/>
       and FloodPlain,
       <br/>
       is
       <br/>
       insufficient and should be redesigned (TOB-BUNNI-6).

       have modifications that are insufficiently documented.
       <br/>
       The system is incredibly configurable with many different
       <br/>
       and optional features that can interact. While this
       <br/>
       increases the flexibility of the system, it also increases
       <br/>
       the attack surface. From a security perspective,
       <br/>
       implementing the protocol through Uniswap v4 hooks
       <br/>
       provides a solid foundation instead of reinventing the
       <br/>
       wheel, but it also introduces a second codebase that
       <br/>
       must be understood at a deep level, with its own coding
       <br/>
       style and underlying assumptions.
       <br/>
       The system would benefit from reducing code
       <br/>
       duplication outlined in the Code Quality Issues section.
       <br/>
       The LDFs and BunniSwapMath
       <br/>
       contain very complex
       <br/>
       arithmetic that is difficult to fully verify. We discovered
       <br/>
       multiple invariant failures that should be investigated
       <br/>
       further; for more information, see the Automated Testing
       <br/>
       section. The system lacks a systematic approach to
       <br/>
       rounding directions and handling of arithmetic errors.

       and vaults. Any of these components could be misused
       <br/>
       by a malicious deployer to drain users' assets.

       Additionally, the AmAmm
       <br/>

       <br/>
       update fees at any point. Users should be made aware of

       The system contains extensive public documentation

       along with white papers. The public documentation
       <br/>
       provides a good high-level overview of the protocol, and
       <br/>
       the inline code documentation explains what the code is
       <br/>
       doing during more complex flows. Given how highly
       <br/>
       configurable pools are, providing users with sensible
       <br/>
       defaults and how to set parameters in a safe way will be
       <br/>
       crucial. Currently, the Guides section of the public

       <br/>
       of assembly, but this is mostly in the form of simple
       <br/>
       statements and packing variables, and most of the more

       As a result of the way the protocol is designed, the test
       <br/>
       suite leans more on integration tests. The LDFs are

       covered with unit tests, with the exception of the
       <br/>
       BuyTheDipGeometricDistribution
       <br/>
       contract, which
       <br/>
       only has limited coverage. The tests are generally
       <br/>
       parameterized to allow for fuzzing. Given the high level of
       <br/>
       configurability, the test suite relies too heavily on
       <br/>
       hard-coded parameters. For example, the tests in

       BunniHub.t.sol
       <br/>
       all use a GeometricDistribution

    However, once a user signs a payload and sends it to another user, they have no way of revoking this signature. Since only one nonce is valid until it is consumed, this would prevent the original user from submitting permit signatures with a different nonce. They could still generate a new signature using the same nonce; however, the user with whom they shared the original signature could execute their transaction first in order to prevent it from being invalidated.

    The BunniHub contract can give approvals to spend a certain amount of its tokens to an ERC-4626 vault in order to deposit these tokens into the vault.

    The AmAmm contract implements an auction mechanism that sells the rights to set and collect swap fees to the highest bidder. The proceeds of the auction are deducted over time as rent and distributed to liquidity providers in lieu of the swap fees that they have forfeited. The bidding process is defined in such a way that the top bidder and rent are determined K units of time (for Bunni v2, this is 24 hours) in advance of them taking effect.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Per the written description, the next bidder should be able to withdraw their deposit as long as they leave enough deposit to cover any difference, if any, between the remaining time left on the current top bidder's deposit and 24 hours. Therefore, if the current top bidder has at least 24 hours of deposit left, the next highest bidder should be able to withdraw their full deposit. The implementation used by Bunni v2, however, requires that the next highest bidder always leaves at least 24 hours of deposit regardless of the state of the current top bidder's deposit.

    This difference in behavior introduces more risk to bidders who wish to act as the fee manager but do not wish to exceed the current top bidder, as some portion of their funds may remain locked in the contract until the current top bidder exhausts their deposit completely or they are outbid by somebody else. This may also unintentionally incentivize top bidders to extend their reign longer than strictly economically necessary in order to spite competitors and also incentivize bidders to wait until there is no active top bidder to begin submitting bids, creating more gaps where the pool falls back to the default swap fee mechanism that may expose LPs to more arbitrage opportunities and reduce their overall earnings.

    Exploit Scenario
   </h4>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Alice is the current swap fee manager, pays 10 BunniToken in rent per epoch, and has 40 tokens deposited. Bob notices that Alice only has a small deposit remaining and submits a bid at eight tokens per epoch and includes a 192-token deposit. Alice also notices her deposit was running low and deposits tokens to top up her deposit to 23 hours total. Alice can repeat this top up every day. Bob cannot recover any of his 192 tokens until Alice's deposit is exhausted or someone outbids him.

    Short term, update the user- and developer-facing documentation so that users bidding through the am-AMM are aware of the risks.

    During the am-AMM auction bidding process, a user vying to be a future manager can bid extremely low rent, even zero, in the absence of a current am-AMM manager or next bids, distorting the bidding process.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    As depicted in figure 4.1, in function bid in the AmAmm contract, when a user places a new bid, the rent is compared with the existing next bid rent and is set as the next bid if the rent is 10% more than the existing next bid rent. In the absence of an existing next bid, the user's rent can be zero and still pass the sanity checks. As a result, future bidders may also opt for bidding low rent, aiming to be just above 10% of the previous rent.
   </p>
   <pre>// update state machine

This scenario allows the winning bidder to attain the manager's role at a substantially low rent and earn significantly more in swap fees.

    Since the FloodPlain contract allows arbitrary functions to be executed on arbitrary targets, this contract has a high-severity vulnerability where a call to permit2 can be inserted into the preHooks or postHooks array in order to consume the permit2 coupon for other users and steal their tokens.

   <p block-type="Text">
    Due to this, anyone can drain the balance of the BunniHook contract for any token that has an outstanding rebalance order by inserting a call to permit2 into the preHooks or postHooks arrays with the correct witness, witnessTypeString, and poolId variables but a changed receiver address.

    Exploit Scenario
   </h4>
   <p block-type="Text">
    A pool contains 10,000 USDC and 20,000 USDT, and a rebalance order is created to sell 5,000 USDT and get 5,000 USDC. Eve creates a fake order that contains the actual rebalance pre- and post-hook in the preHooks array, but leaves the postHooks array empty. The output amount is pulled from the BunniHub contract and stays in the BunniHook contract. Eve then creates another fake order and inserts a call to the permit2 contract's permitWitnessTransferFrom function in the preHooks array to transfer the amount to herself. This passes since the signature is considered valid whenever the correct hash and PoolId are supplied to the isValidSignature function and since the permit2 call was made from the FloodPlain contract.

    The liquidity density functions used by Bunni v2 pools can be configured to adapt to changes in market conditions. As a result, the protocol also includes a mechanism to autonomously rebalance the holdings of a pool to maximize the liquidity available. However, the way liquidity is added and removed from pools can be leveraged to artificially inflate pool balances temporarily in order to create abnormally large and profitable rebalance orders.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    The amount of liquidity in a pool can be calculated by multiplying a token's balance by the overall token density according to the LDF. Since we have two tokens per pool, each with independent balances and densities, we can infer two possible liquidity amounts (figure 9.1). Under normal conditions, these values should be approximately equal, but if the LDF shifts or morphs somehow, the densities of each token may change. Since the balances will remain constant, this means that the liquidity values implied by the balances may differ. If the difference in these liquidity estimates exceeds a pool-configured threshold (figure 9.2), a rebalance order will be issued through flood.bid that trades a portion of the excess token to increase the overall liquidity.

    If there is an active AmAmm manager, withdrawals would be subject to a timeout window, but the version of the code under review has a known issue that allows this to be bypassed. Since the AmAmm manager is also included on the allowlist of fulfillers, this would allow arbitrary attackers to fulfill orders provided they win the AmAmm auction 24 hours in advance. Otherwise, any allowlisted fulfiller would be able to execute this attack.

   <p block-type="Text">
    Additionally, regular depositors could use flash loans to provide just-in-time liquidity to inflate the rebalance order to require a greater amount of tokens than would naturally be in the pool, requiring fulfillers to also take the extra step of providing just-in-time liquidity back into the pool to carry out the rebalance, resulting in a swap that is less profitable than it appeared based on the order parameters alone.

    TokenA and 900 TokenB so the pool has 1,200 TokenA and 1,000 TokenB in total. She makes a small swap to trigger the creation of a rebalance order. This pool has a 5% rebalance slippage tolerance so the rebalance order will sell 100 TokenA for 95 TokenB. Alice withdraws all of her original liquidity and immediately fills the rebalance order. As a result, the pool has 20 TokenA and 195 TokenB. If Alice had not provided just-in-time liquidity, the pool would have only swapped 10 TokenA for 9.5 TokenB and ended at a total of 110 TokenA and 109.5 TokenB. Since the target ratio for the tokens is currently 1:1, we can assume they have the same price, and see that if each token was worth $1, Alice made an excess profit of $4.50, or just over 2% of the original total pool value.

    However, a malicious AmAmm manager could use this mechanism to protect themselves from arbitrage while they are manipulating the TWAP price. It is important to note that the BunniHook defines a maximum swap fee that can be used; however, this value could be misconfigured or naively set to a high value. Additionally, the use of a truncated Oracle makes this manipulation take longer since the TWAP price will gradually update over several blocks.

    Alice deploys a pool with a BunniHook that has 100% as the maximum swap fee. Her pool's TWAP price is used in an external lending protocol to determine asset prices.

She then proceeds to borrow a large amount of assets to manipulate the TWAP price over several blocks and sets the swap fees to 100% to protect her manipulation against arbitrage.

    The expectation is that, for the same pool state, both swap configurations (ExactIn and ExactOut) should result in the same amounts of input and output tokens. However, the computeSwap function deviates from this expected behavior. For example, in an ExactIn configuration, computeSwap may exchange x amount of input tokens for y output tokens, but in an ExactOut configuration, it may exchange x' input tokens for the same y output tokens, where x' is smaller than x. This allows users to provide fewer input tokens in the ExactOut configuration for the same amount of y tokens compared to an ExactIn swap.

    The swap functionality of BunniSwapMath can result in arithmetic underflow during the swap on a valid pool state, disrupting swap operations.

   <p block-type="Text">
    The computeSwap function in the BunniSwapMath library enables users to swap tokens on a valid pool state. Based on the amountSpecified and swap direction, it calculates the input tokens exchanged for output tokens and updates the pool's state and pricing ratio at the end of the swap.

    Given a valid pool state and input parameters for the computeSwap function, the swap should succeed. However, BunniSwapMath deviates from this expected behavior, leading to an arithmetic underflow during the swap. For a OneForZero swap, during the calculation of input and output amount, the updatedActiveBalance for token1 becomes less than the currentActiveBalance of token1; this condition is not accounted for, as highlighted in figure 18.1. This results in an arithmetic underflow that causes the swap operation to revert.

    Stateless invariant testing involves verifying that invariants of a system are true across various operations, particularly when the system does not maintain internal state between operations. Since the system is stateless, each request's input should be sanitized such that it produces a valid output, regardless of any past history.

In the following section, we provide some details of the harness we wrote and some unit tests instances that resulted in failures.

    F. Fix Review Results
   </h1>
   <p block-type="Text">
    When undertaking a fix review, Trail of Bits reviews the fixes implemented for issues identified in the original report. This work involves a review of specific areas of the source code and system configuration, not comprehensive analysis of the system.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    From January 2 to January 6, 2025, Trail of Bits reviewed the fixes and mitigations implemented by the Bacon Labs team for the issues identified in this report. We reviewed each fix to determine its effectiveness in resolving the associated issue.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    We marked the fix status of TOB-BUNNI-4 as resolved since it sufficiently mitigates the risks described in this finding. However, the fix potentially introduces a denial-of-service attack vector, which is described in the detailed fix review result for this finding. The findings TOB-BUNNI-9, TOB-BUNNI-18, and TOB-BUNNI-19 were considered partially resolved and would benefit from further investigation. During the fix review, we were unable to determine the fix status of the three issues marked as undetermined due to the scope and complexity of the changes.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    We recommend that the Bacon Labs team conduct a follow-up security review of the system with a focus on the system arithmetic, and continue improving the unit and fuzz testing suite to verify the system behaves as expected. This follow-up review should address the concerns raised in the detailed fix review results for TOB-BUNNI-4 and the partially resolved and undetermined issues.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    In summary, of the 19 issues described in this report, Bacon Labs has resolved 10 issues, has partially resolved four issues, and has not resolved two issues. We could not determine the resolution status of the remaining three issues during this fix review. For additional information, please see the Detailed Fix Review Results below.

    . A MIN_RENT function was added to the AmAmm and BunniHook contracts that dynamically defines the minimum rent that a user can bid as a percentage of the total supply of Bunni tokens. While this sufficiently resolves the issue described in this finding, there is a chance this could be used to perform a denial-of-service attack on other user bids by front-running their bid with a deposit in order to increase the total supply of Bunni tokens, in turn making the affected user's rent too low. Additionally, since the minRentMultiplier parameter is immutable, the system should be tested with various values of the parameter to determine its impact on the economic and incentive structure of the system.

    . The Bacon Labs team uses a modified version of the FloodPlain contract that disallows direct calls to the permit2 contract in the pre- and post-hooks, as well as appends the generated order hash to the end of the calldata for verification. When a pre- or post-hook is executed, the order hash is checked against the one saved in state for that ID. This prevents access control bypass and selective execution of pre- and post-hooks. We did not review the bytecode used for deployment of FloodPlain in the FloodDeployer contract.

    The PR adds a canWithdraw function that is called when a user attempts to withdraw liquidity through the BunniHub contract. The canWithdraw function checks if a rebalance order is currently active, and if it is, it prevents withdrawals. While this does mitigate the exploit scenario described in the finding, it does not prevent the inflation of the rebalance order amounts. A malicious user could still deposit liquidity prior to the creation of the rebalance order to inflate the amounts; however, they would need to execute the rebalance order prior to being able to withdraw, which may not be profitable. Additionally, it might be possible to intentionally perform a denial-of-service attack on user withdrawals by disbalancing the pool, but we were unable to determine if this is possible during the fix review.

   <p block-type="Text">
    This issue should be investigated further by listing out all of the possible scenarios where the rebalance order amounts could be inflated and abused, and by creating unit and fuzz tests to determine the profitability and likelihood of such scenarios taking place.

    . An additional parameter was added to the DecodedHookParams struct that defines the maximum AmAmm swap fee. A constant was added to limit the maximum swap fee to 10%. This reduces the risk of an AmAmm manager manipulating the TWAP price, since they cannot prevent other users from using the pool via the swap fee parameter. However, if the pool-defined maximum swap fee is less than the maximum AmAmm swap fee, an AmAmm manager can set the swap fee to be larger than the pool-defined maximum due to a code change in the _payloadIsValid function. The Bacon Labs team stated that this is an intentional design choice.

    The computeSwap function of the BunniSwapMath library contract was updated so that the arithmetic does not revert on an underflow, but rather returns zero. While this does partially address this issue, we did not manage to determine if this has any important side effects on other parts of the system, or if it can lead to incorrect calculation during certain edge cases.

    The cumulative amounts calculated in the inverseCumulativeAmount0 and inverseCumulativeAmount1 functions of the LibUniformDistribution library contract are checked against a maximum value for the respective cumulative amount. If the computed value is greater than the maximum value, the function will return zero and false, indicating a failure in the operation. While this does prevent incorrect calculations from being considered correct in the system, the solution appears to be a workaround rather than a systematic fix of the underlying issue. We were unable to determine the side effects of this change during the duration of the fix review.
