    Sigma Prime was commercially engaged to perform a time-boxed security review of the current Ethereum implementation of the AdEx Protocol. AdEx is a blockchain-powered advertisement exchange aiming at disrupting the existing online advertising landscape and addressing its significant problems, including advertising fraud, privacy, and consent to receiving sponsored messages.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    This review focused on AdEx's payment channel implementation named
    <a href="https://github.com/AdExNetwork/adex-protocol/blob/master/OUTPACE.md">
     OUTPACE
    </a>
    via AdExCore , libraries ChannelLibrary , SignatureValidator , MerkleProof , and the SafeERC20 token wrapper.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    The review focused solely on the security aspects of the Solidity implementation of the smart contracts, but also includes general recommendations and informational comments relating to minimising gas usage, along with general code quality observations.

    AdEx acknowledges that validator consensus can break, in the event that all parties or the majority of validators become malicious. It is emphasized that such scenarios can be mitigated through publisher consortiums, reputation monitoring, and adding 3rd party tie-breakers as additional validators.

    AdEx acknowledges that with AdEx Protocol, traditional digital advertising fraud and Sybil attacks would still be possible. It is emphasized that future development will include anti-fraud tooling, end-user level proof of work requirements, identify verification, and other mitigations. The current implementation of the AdEx protocol heavily relies on off-chain components as part of its security model (particularly the AdEx SDK).

     "OUTPACE channel should have 2-3 times as long of a duration, in order to allow extra time for publishers to withdraw their revenue."
    </i>
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    However, in the current core implementation, there is no minimum time requirement for each channel's validUntil duration. Thus, publishers have to rely on the
    <i>
     Market
    </i>
    (a RESTful service) to compute and communicate all time constraints. This Market layer cannot be entirely trusted.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Assuming the time interval is erroneously communicated to publishers, or simply not accounted for by publishers, there exists a realistic edge case where channels expire before publishers are able to withdraw earned revenues.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Similarly, a malicious advertiser can also create a channel with a small active time window, with just enough time for publishers to confirm a bid, but not enough time to allow payment withdrawal. After the channel expires, the advertiser is able to withdraw the remaining balance without paying publishers.

   </h4>
   <p block-type="Text">
    AdEx acknowledges this potential
    <b>
     stuck revenue
    </b>
    problem. The current implementation suggests publishers will reliably check for expiration times off-chain and will account for this potential issue.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Another recommendation is to impose a reasonable MIN_VALIDITY time interval (as a constant in ChannelLibrary ) for each channel upon channel creation. This constant could be used to restrict channels to have minimum lengths.

    <i>
     "the market needs to track all on-chain OUTPACE channels and needs to constantly monitor their liveness (&gt;=2/3 validators online and producing new states) and state."

    .
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Furthermore, the AdexCore maintains a public states mapping that signals whether channels are Unknown , Active , or Expired .
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Current design and implementation seem to permit clumsy providers or market-builders to mistake states for a reliable source of channel
    <i>
     state
    </i>
    . It is possible that users will rely on the getChannelState getter function to read this information on-chain and see if the channel has expired.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    This is problematic since the states mapping does not accurately describe the latest actual channel state. For example, the only way for a channel state to become Expired is if the advertiser withdraws their balance upon channel expiry. Expired channels, whose advertisers have not yet withdrawn, will show up as Active in the related on-chain states .

     Recommendations

   </h4>
   <p block-type="Text">
    A getter function could be implemented, which would leverage the isValid() function on Active states with the current blocktime to return a more accurate description of whether a channel's state is truly active and valid.

There is a separate system to track the overall channel state (the validator stack), which is also aware of campaign health and whether all funds in the channel are distributed (Exchausted state) that takes care of that. Our internal recommendation would be to rename the state getter".

       Gas Saving  For-loop Convention

      In MerkleProof.sol line [8], the for-loop terminates when i!=proof.length . It may be better to terminate the for-loop as of i &lt; proof.length for better readability. This would also save gas, as the EVM takes one additional opcode to perform a "not equals" check than it takes to perform a "less than" check. ✓ Resolved in commit
