     Overview

   </h4>
   <p block-type="Text">
    The LendingPool contract is an ERC4626-compliant token vault designed to increase the utilisation of a liquid restaking token (LRT) through lending and borrowing activities. Users with LRT can become lenders by depositing their tokens into the pool. The pool operator then lends the collected tokens or funds to borrowers through loan contracts. Lenders can withdraw from the scheme at any time, and the pool operator reserves the right to call the loans whenever necessary to ensure the required funds are available for returning to the lenders.

    The manual review focused on identifying issues associated with the business logic implementation of the contracts. This includes their internal interactions, intended functionality and correct implementation with respect to the underlying functionality of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (for example, verifying correct storage/memory layout).
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Additionally, the manual review process focused on identifying vulnerabilities related to known Solidity antipatterns and attack vectors, such as re-entrancy, front-running, integer overflow/underflow and correct visibility specifiers.

    Two nonReentrant modifiers are executed in a single call, causing ReentrancyGuard to revert during liquidate() .

   <p block-type="Text">
    When the function AbstractLender.liquidate() is called, the following call sequence occurs.
   </p>
   <p block-type="ListGroup">
    <ul>
     <li block-type="ListItem">
      1. AbstractLender.liquidate() is called on the lender contract. The function has a nonReentrant modifier. At this point, _reentrancyStatus is set to _REENTRANCY_ENTERED .

      2. IPeerToPeerOpenTermLoan(loanAddr).liquidate() is called on the respective loan contract. This code may execute InitializableOpenTermLoan.liquidate() .

      3. IHookableLender(lender).notifyLoanMatured() is called on the lender contract. The function has a nonReentrant modifier as described in HookableLender.sol .

   <p block-type="Text">
    Since the _reentrancyStatus of the lender contract was already set to _REENTRANCY_ENTERED in step (1), the call in step (3) would cause a revert on BaseReentrancyGuard._nonReentrantBefore() . The result is, AbstractLender.liquidate() will revert.

    If lagDuration == 0 , users may have only a limited period, potentially just 1 hour in a day, to claim their token.

    When lagDuration == 0 , the pool is not time-locked. Therefore, users are supposed to redeem their tokens instantly.

    The first depositor may execute an inflation attack to prevent other users from depositing.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    A malicious first depositor can inflate the rate between the shares and assets. This can be done by first depositing the lowest possible amount of supported assets to the vault, then transferring a large amount of assets to the vault contract directly without calling deposit() or mint() . The asset transfer will artificially inflate the share price for future depositors. If their deposited amount is less than a specific value, legitimate users cannot deposit due to the check statement on line [
    <b>
     100

    ] because their shares will be 0 due to the share price inflation.

   <p block-type="ListGroup">

      3. The attacker inflates the rate by transferring the underlying asset directly to the vault. Let us assume they transfer 10_000e6 - 1 . Now we have totalAssets() == 10_000e6 and totalSupply() == 1 .
     </li>
     <li block-type="ListItem">
      4. At this point, legitimate users cannot deposit an amount less than 10_000e6 . This is because if the deposited amount is less than 10_000e6 , the expected shares will be zero, since shares = totalSupply * depositedAmount / totalAssets , and therefore we have shares = 1 * depositedAmount / 10_000e6 which yields zero shares.
