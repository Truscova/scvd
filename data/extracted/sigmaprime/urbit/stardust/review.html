    Sigma Prime was commercially engaged by Tlon Corportation to perform a time-boxed security review of a set of smart contracts related to the Stardust project. The review focused solely on the security aspects of the Solidity implementation of the contract, though general recommendations and informational comments are also provided.

     Overview
    </b>
   </h4>
   <p block-type="Text">
    <b>
     Urbit
    </b>
    is designed as a peer-to-peer personal operating system running on cloud infrastructures.
    <b>
     Azimuth
    </b>
    is one of the core subsystems in Urbit that manages identities or
    <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/the-urbit-address-space">
     address space.
    </a>
    It is essentially a public key infrastructure built on top of smart contract-based blockchains. Its structure is similar to how IPv4 is designed, with dedicated terms such as galaxies, stars, planets, and moons, that identify the granularity of the identity, similar to classful addressing in IPv4. While the Azimuth contract is used to store all identity information, all operations to Azimuth must go through the Ecliptic contract, which owns Azimuth.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    The
    <b>
     Stardust
    </b>
    project is a set of smart contracts developed by community members allowing owners of Azimuth identities to deposit their related ERC-721 tokens and obtain a fungible token (
    <b>
     StarToken
    </b>
    , an ERC-777 token) representing this ownership. Specifically, the Treasury contract allows a star owner to deposit the star and receive 1
    <i>
     e
    </i>
    18 $STAR tokens. Anyone can also redeem a star from the Treasury contract for a fix amount of 1
    <i>
     e
    </i>
    18 $STAR tokens. $STAR tokens are therefore only minted when a star is deposited, and burned when a star is redeemed.

     Note: the Azimuth, Ecliptic and StarToken contracts were excluded from the scope of this assessment but used extensively during testing. Additionally, OpenZepplin contracts and libraries were also excluded from the scope of this review.

   <p block-type="Text">
    The manual code review section of the report, focused on identifying any and all issues/vulnerabilities associated with the business logic implementation of the contracts. Specifically, their internal interactions, intended functionality and correct implementation with respect to the underlying functionality of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (for example, verifying correct storage/memory layout). Additionally, the manual review process focused on all known Solidity anti-patterns and attack vectors. These include, but are not limited to, the following vectors: re-entrancy, front-running, integer overflow/underflow and correct visibility specifiers.

     Description

   </h4>
   <p block-type="Text">
    A user can mistakenly transfer ownership of a star to the Treasury contract. Consider the following case:
   </p>
   <p block-type="ListGroup">
    <ul>
     <li block-type="ListItem">
      1. Alice spawns a star;
     </li>
     <li block-type="ListItem">
      2. Instead of setting Treasury as a proxy through Ecliptic.setSpawnProxy() , Alice calls a different function, Ecliptic.transferPoint() . The star ownership changes from Alice to Treasury ;
     </li>
     <li block-type="ListItem">
      3. Treasury was not notified of such transfer and therefore the star is not recorded in the assets ;
     </li>
     <li block-type="ListItem">
      4. Alice cannot take back the mistakenly transferred star.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </p>
   <h4>
    <b>
     Recommendations
    </b>
   </h4>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Consider adding a function to account for transferred stars into the assets array. For this purpose, a mapping can help check whether the star has been included in assets :
   </p>
   <pre>mapping ( uint16 =&gt; bool ) assetMap ;</pre>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Then, the following function can be used.
   </p>
   <pre>function addToAsset ( uint16 _star ) public {
 require ( assetMap [ _star ] == false , " Treasury : The star is in the assets ");</pre>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Notice that additional instructions are necessary on the functions deposit() and redeem() . In the deposit() function, the following instruction can be added on line [

    ]:

    A Treasury contract is coupled with a StarToken (ERC-777 standard) token. StarToken tokens are minted to a user who deposits a star to the Treasury contract and burned when a user redeems a star.

    The testing team could not identify an exploitable attack vector for reentrancy on the Treasury contract. However, the testing team notes that the ERC777 and ERC1820 contracts were not included in the scope of this review. As a result, the testing team cannot express any opinions related to the security posture of these contracts.

     Recommendations

   </h4>
   <p block-type="Text">
    <span id="page-16-0">
    </span>
    ERC777 token contracts do significantly increase the attack surface available to malicious users, compared to simpler ERC20 token contracts. Consider whether the added complexity is worth the extra features provided.

   <h4>
    1.
    <b>
     No Clear Revert Message
    </b>
   </h4>
   <p block-type="Text">
    The Treasury contract does not provide clear revert messages upon reverting. Therefore, users or developers may find it hard to track why a transaction fails.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    We suggest introducing the following revert messages:

      line [

      </i>
      .
     </li>

   </p>
   <h4>
    2.
    <b>
     Redundant Star Ownership Check
    </b>
   </h4>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Treasury contract acquires stars from users who called function deposit() . In this function, the deposited stars' ownership is transferred from the users to Treasury contract and stored in assets list.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Function redeem() redeems a star by burning 1e18 STAR tokens and transfers the ownership of a star from assets list to the redeeming user. However, there is an extra star ownership check in line [
    <b>
     132
    </b>
    ] which is not necessary.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    As a recommendation, the code on line [
    <b>
     132
    </b>
    ] can safely be removed.

   <h4>
    3.
    <b>
     Data Type Unmatched: uint16 for _star and uint32 for point
    </b>
   </h4>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Variable _star used in Treasury contract is a uint16. This variable matches the point variable in the Azimuth and Ecliptic contracts. _star and point are of type uint16 and uint32 respectively. Although a _star address is represented in
    <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/star">
     16 bits data,
    </a>
    we recommend keeping the _star data type to uint32 for code consistency.
