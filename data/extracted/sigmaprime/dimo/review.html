   <p block-type="Text">
    Sigma Prime was commercially engaged to perform a time-boxed security review of the Dimo Network smart contracts. This included the Token, Vesting and Identity smart contracts. The review focused solely on the security aspects of the Solidity implementation of the contract, though general recommendations and informational comments are also provided.

   <p block-type="Text">
    Dimo Network contracts in the current audit scope included the following projects:
   </p>
   <p block-type="ListGroup">
    <ul>
     <li block-type="ListItem">
      <b>
       Dimo Token:
      </b>
      an ERC20Token which will be used in the extended Dimo Network for accounting purposes. The token is intended for use within Dimo Vesting contracts and as use within Governance protocols.
     </li>
     <li block-type="ListItem">
      <b>
       Dimo Vesting:
      </b>
      a contract which handles the issuance of tokens held by Dimo beneficiaries. The delivery is managed through a standard vesting lockout period and redeemable iteratively after a set cliff period has expired.
     </li>
     <li block-type="ListItem">
      <b>
       Dimo Web3 Identity:
      </b>
      a modular NFT capable of delegating calls to permissioned modules with access to specific storage slots. This modular contract aims at storing, updating and deleting defined attributes based on the requirements of the Dimo NFT. More specifically, this contract can store and update user permissions, vehicle attributes and approved modules. The ability for future modules to be added allows the contract to adapt to changing requirements of the Dimo Network.

    The manual code review section of the report is focused on identifying any and all issues/vulnerabilities associated with the business logic implementation of the contracts. This includes their internal interactions, intended functionality and correct implementation with respect to the underlying functionality of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (for example, verifying correct storage/memory layout). Additionally, the manual review process focused on all known Solidity anti-patterns and attack vectors. These include, but are not limited to, the following vectors: re-entrancy, front-running, integer overflow/underflow and correct visibility specifiers. For a more thorough, but non-exhaustive list of examined vectors, see

    The Polygon child token contract (also called Dimo.sol ) has both a deposit() function for the Polygon bridge, but also a mint() function. As the main token is on the Ethereum blockchain, the purpose of this child token is to serve as a bridged representation of the Ethereum Mainnet token on Polygon.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    However, this function is incompatible due to the capacity to mint tokens on Polygon that do not correspond to tokens on the Ethereum Mainnet.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Consider this simplified scenario involving a situation where no tokens have been bridged to Polygon:
   </p>
   <p block-type="ListGroup">
    <ul>
     <li block-type="ListItem">
      1. Alice uses the Polygon bridge to bridge 1,000 DIMO tokens to Polygon from the Ethereum Mainnet. She receives 1,000 child tokens and her original tokens are locked in the bridge.
     </li>
     <li block-type="ListItem">
      2. MINTER_ROLE is able to call mint() on the child token contract. He receives 1,000 child tokens on Polygon.
     </li>
     <li block-type="ListItem">
      3. MINTER_ROLE bridges his tokens back to Ethereum Mainnet, and receives the 1,000 DIMO tokens locked by Alice.

     <li block-type="ListItem">
      4. Alice attempts to bridge back to Mainnet. There are no tokens available in the Polygon bridge resulting in a net deficit.

    After discussion with the development team, this issue has been deemed inapplicable/irrelevant as far as security risks are concerned. Polygon documentation references the requirement for mintable assets in their documentation

     here.

    We have lowered the severity to informational as total token supply is split across ethereum and polygon chains in a manner that might be confusing. With a solely ETH minted asset, its total supply would always be canonical.

    The development team might want to consider adding the DIMORegistry contract itself as a module, with all of its function signatures, simply to block potential collisions. If a tool such as hardhat is used to list all of a contract's selectors, then nothing will be missed.

    Alternatively, a require check could be added within _addModule with DIMORegistry 's function signatures. This would be more reliable as it could not be removed.

    The DIMOVesting contract expects transfers to be made before creating a vesting schedule using createVestingSchedule() . As a result, there are checks to ensure that funds are sufficient.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    However, if a user accidentally transfers funds to the vesting contract and the owner creates the vesting schedule without transferring, this will lock funds that did not belong to the owner.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Reversing this process is unnecessarily challenging. The owner will need to revoke the schedule, transfer the funds back to the user and then transfer new funds to the vesting schedule, whilst accounting for any potentially released funds, then creating the vesting schedule again.

In the case of tokens, however, as the functionality is simple, well established, and successfully implemented in many other instances, upgradeability is often viewed as an unacceptable risk by users.

    Unfortunately, the only way to convert an upgradeable proxy token to a standard token is to create a new contract and allow the tokens to be swapped for each other.

    Nevertheless, transitioning to a static contract for a token is recommended for the benefits in stability and reliability it would provide.

    An initialize() function in a proxy implementation is used to set the initial values within the storage space of the proxy contract. DimoV2 lacks such a function, and the reason for that seems to be that these values were already set within the first version of the Dimo token contract.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    So long as the contract DimoV2 is only used to upgrade from a successfully initialised first version Dimo token contract, this does not cause any problems.

    The functionality of DIMORegistry relies on delegatecall . However, this design decision may present significant risks in the future.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    Indeed, any module that is added to DIMORegistry can potentially access and modify any part of the storage of DIMORegistry . That means it can grant any role, change any token allocation, or add other modules. The greatest danger is that a module is added which in some way ends up making a call to selfdestruct . This would cause DIMORegistry itself to delete its own code and result in a denial of service for any dependency contracts.

    After discussion with the development team, and careful evaluation of the design, the testing team acknowledges this issue as an informational. Notwithstanding the informational status of this finding, the development team should place a high priority on ensuring that all modules added to DIMORegistry are reviewed for security. These reviews should not be performed in isolation, but rather ensure that the interactions with other existing modules are sound. Specific weight should be placed on ensuring storage collisions do not occur.

    ] shows the use of OpenZeppelin Hardhat upgrades plugin. This plugin requires the explicit declaration of the proxy type as follows: upgrades.deployProxy(Dimo, {kind: 'UUPS'}) . In the implementation, the kind of proxy is missing. OZ documentation states that use of function deployProxy() that is missing a value for proxy type will deploy as Transparent proxy.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    In practice, the default behaviour of the proxy types were being altered at the time of deployment, which explains the behaviour of the contract deployments on mainnet. On mainnet, TokenV1 was deployed as an ERC1967 proxy. During the upgrade to V2, logic was included to ensure UUPS implementations were inherited and valid _authorizeUpgrade overrides prevented arbitrary users from upgrading the token. The mainnet TokenV2 contains logic to ensure only UPGRADER_ROLE is able to upgrade, which effectively mitigates the issue in the deployment script logic.
   </p>
   <p block-type="Text">
    It is worth mentioning that the current UPGRADER_ROLE is held by the GNOSIS SAFE Proxy contract with address 84ae2025b9620fd926d4e60673fcea2385c79d8a .

    It is best practice to structure code in the order of making checks then updating variables and lastly interacting externally. This is to prevent reentrancy. Although there was no specific exploitable reentrancy occurrence detected (apart from
    <a href="#page-19-0">
     DMO-14)

    , it is nonetheless recommended to reorder code to follow the

     Incorrect Error Message/Unreachable Code:
    </b>
   </h4>
   <p block-type="Text">
    DIMORegistry line [
    <b>
     161
    </b>
    ] states that a selector is unregistered. By the logic of this contract, this check should always pass, as execution can only reach this point if the check on line [
    <b>
     153
    </b>
    ] established that s.selectorsHash[implementation] is equal to a hash that contains the selector in question. Nevertheless, it could be modified by a module. In that case, the comment could be incorrect: a selector that is registered to a different implementation would also fail this check.
   </p>
   <h4>
    6.
    <b>
     Registry Function Signature Collisions:
    </b>
   </h4>
   <p block-type="Text">
    DIMORegistry does not allow modules to be added if s.implementations[selectors[i]] != address(0) , therefore registered function selectors cannot be duplicated across modules. This provides some security benefits, however, function signatures can collide. For example withdraw(uint256) and OwnerTransferV7b711143(uint256) unexpectedly produce a single function signature of 2e1a7d4d . All modules should therefore be checked for any potential function signature collisions with other modules.
